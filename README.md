KatamariSBC is the place for all the files and info for the KatamariSBC Cluster.

The goal of this project is to devise an easy (for some definition of easy) solution for non CS researchers to spin up a cluster to do acutal work. Both traditional HPC work and an investigation into using kubernetes as a way to rapidly provision worker nodes will be pursued.
